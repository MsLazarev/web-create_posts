# web-create_posts
small web site on Flask where you can create your posts and check other posts. 

16.04.2024
The main backend has been implemented, 
now Iâ€™m working on the design, 
then I plan to add deletion of posts, likes and dislikes, a tab with posts on a specific topic.

if you want clear db so delete "#" from db_scripts.py(117 line). 

22.04.2024 i made topics and i cant do navigation bar that i want so this website will be have a bad 
design. Maybe later i will do likes and dislikes on post. I should prepare for my exams
